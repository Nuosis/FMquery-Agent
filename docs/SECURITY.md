# Security Best Practices for FMquery-Agent

This document outlines security best practices for FMquery-Agent.

## General Security

-   **Keep Dependencies Up-to-Date**: Regularly update all dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities.
-   **Input Validation**: Validate all user inputs to prevent injection attacks.
-   **Secure Configuration**: Store sensitive information (e.g., API keys) in environment variables and avoid hardcoding them in the code.
-   **Least Privilege Principle**: Grant only the necessary permissions to users and processes.
-   **Regular Security Audits**: Conduct regular security audits to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.

## Data Protection

-   **Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data both in transit and at rest.
-   **Data Sanitization**: Sanitize data before storing it to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
-   **Access Control**: Implement strict access control policies to protect sensitive data.
-   **Data Backup**: Regularly back up data to prevent data loss.

## Potential Vulnerabilities

-   **Injection Attacks**: SQL injection, command injection, and XSS attacks.
-   **Authentication and Authorization**: Weak authentication and authorization mechanisms.
-   **Data Exposure**: Exposure of sensitive data due to misconfiguration or vulnerabilities.
-   **Denial of Service (DoS)**: Vulnerabilities that can lead to denial of service.
-   **Third-Party Dependencies**: Vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies.

## Monitoring

-   **Log Analysis**: Monitor logs for suspicious activity.
-   **Intrusion Detection**: Implement an intrusion detection system to detect and respond to security incidents.
-   **Vulnerability Scanning**: Regularly scan for vulnerabilities using automated tools.
